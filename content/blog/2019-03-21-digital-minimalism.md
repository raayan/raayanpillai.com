Finished this in one sitting. 
To say I didn't agree with the premise of this book before picking it up would be an understatement. 
Regardless, the points are summarized and presented in an elegant and unpretentious way. 
Normally when someone says they don't partake in some popular social media platform you'd think they're out-of-touch, but Cal is on point with his observations and criticisms.
