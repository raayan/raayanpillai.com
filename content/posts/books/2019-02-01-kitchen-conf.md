Bourdain gives a viewpoint on the culinary world opposite to that of your run-of-the-mill cooking show.
I found the writing down to earth and relaxing to consume.
The book aside, I have fond memories of my mom and I watching Anthony's shows when growing up.
She holds the opinion that he did society a great service by exposing the world to each other's cultures.
I wholeheartedly agree.
