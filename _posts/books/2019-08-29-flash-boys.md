Another page turner. Michael Lewis finds a way to make relatively drab concepts, fiber-optic cables and microwave towers, a thrilling ride.
I'm definitely biased here, as I'd likely install a server rack in my home before buying myself a nightstand.
The book highlighted some concepts I was not familiar with; I had heard the term "dark-pool" before but I didn't realize how murky the water really was. 

Nonetheless, this story has something for everyone, whether it's finding out what people mean when they say "computers run the market" or "there are a lot of nerds on Wall Street."

The focus of the story is on "Brad from RBC" and his heroic journey to shed some light on the mystery that is the world of high-frequency trading (HFT). 
I appreciated that the tone of the book was positive, the stories generally told about the financial world involve more turmoil with no recourse. 
This one seems to focus on how the keen and caring can ultimately lift up those around them and change things for the better.
