My mom encouraged me to meditate and sent me to yoga classes as a teen. 
Being the difficult child I was, the advice fell on deaf ears.
Maybe I'm more open to the idea at this point in my life, but Dan Harris has presented meditation in an approachable and applicable way.
The book is exciting to read as it covers a stressful time in Dan's life, highlighting moments where mindfulness brought great peace of mind.
He meets a few other interesting mindfulness experts that help solidify the point (I've also picked up some new to-reads from his suggestions).
Whether you've tried meditation before or not, this book takes an honest approach at trying to convince you and is well worth the read.
