  content: Finished this book in one sitting. To say I didn't agree with the premise of this book before picking it up would be an understatement. Regardless, the points are summarized and presented in an elegant and non-pretentious way. Normally when someone says they don't partake in X social media site you'd think they're out-of-touch with society, but Cal is on point with his observations and criticisms.
