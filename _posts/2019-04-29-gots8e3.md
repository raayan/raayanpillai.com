# Warning!
*SPOILERS AHEAD*

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

# Setup
## Who is the Night King?
The Night King we see today (and was just defeated) is supposed to be one of the First Men (possibly the First Hero?). 

The Children of the Forrest transformed him to protect them and get revenge on the humans that were destroying their land and the Weirwood trees.

## How important is the Night King?
Maybe less about the Night King, more sore the threat of the white walkers, They are the first thing they show (Pilot episode), they are a persitent threat throughout the whole show. This makes it seem like they are a big deal, it's been happening for the past *8 years*. 

The first episode of this show
