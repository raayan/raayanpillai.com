I'm Raayan Pillai, an engineer. I'm interested in minimalism, organization, automation and how those topics intersect with computer science.
I enjoy weightlifting, [reading]({{ page.links.reading }}), and music in my free time.
Some of the random things I build are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}).
Here's my [resume]({{ page.links.resume }}). You can reach me at [raayan@raayanpillai.com](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).
There are some other links at the footer of this page.
