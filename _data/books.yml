    Bourdain gives a viewpoint on the culinary world opposite to that of your run-of-the-mill cooking show.
    I found the writing down to earth and relaxing to consume.
    The book aside, I have fond memories of my mom and I watching Anthony's shows when growing up.
    She holds the opinion that he did society a great service by exposing the world to each other's cultures.
    I wholeheartedly agree.

    Finished this in one sitting. To say I didn't agree with the premise of this book before picking it up would be an understatement. 
    Regardless, the points are summarized and presented in an elegant and unpretentious way. 
    Normally when someone says they don't partake in X social media site you'd think they're out-of-touch with society, but Cal is on point with his observations and criticisms.

    An easy, interesting read that details a fun story from the early days of the cryptocurrency world. 
    For the more technical you may have some nitpicks, but if you can look past that you'll have a good time.

    My mom encouraged me to meditate and sent me to yoga classes as a teen. 
    Being a nimrod, the advice fell on deaf ears.
    Maybe I'm more open to the idea at this point in my life, but Dan Harris has presented meditation in an approachable and applicable way.
    The book is well written and exciting to read as it goes through a stressful time in Dan's life.
    He meets a few other interesting mindfulness experts that help solidify the point (I've also picked up some new to-reads from his suggestions).
    Whether you've tried meditation before or not, this book takes an honest approach at trying to convince you and is well worth the read.
