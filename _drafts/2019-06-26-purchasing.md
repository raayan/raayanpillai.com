# Purchasing

After a year of living with a respected peer/friend it's come to my attention that our strategies for buying items is completely opposite. He errs on the side of frugality at all costs and I'm more likely to spend-up on something I deem durable or well-worth. 

## Attributes of an Item

### Function
_What the item actually does_

### Longevity
_How tough it is as long and its expected lifespan_

### Aesthetics
_What it looks like_

### Price
_How much it costs and will cost in the future to maintain_
