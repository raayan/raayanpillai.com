I'm Raayan Pillai, an engineer. I'm interested in minimalism, organization, automation and how those topics intersect with computer science.

Some things I enjoy in my free time:
- [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/{{ site.author.strava }})
- skiing
- [reading]({{ page.links.reading }})
- contemplating existential dread
- movies
- music

Some of the things I build are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}); my work experience is on my [resume]({{ page.links.resume }}). 

If you have something nice to say, you can reach me at [raayan@raayanpillai.com](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).

There are some other links at the footer of this page.
