# About

I'm Raayan Pillai, an engineer. I'm interested in minimalism, organization, automation and how those topics intersect with computer science.

Some things I enjoy in my free time:
- [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/48514871)
- skiing
- [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20790159-raayan-pillai)
- contemplating existential dread
- movies
- music

Some of the things I build are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/raayan); my work experience is on my [resume](/resume/resume.pdf). 

If you have something to say, [email](mailto:raayan@raayanpillai.com) me.
